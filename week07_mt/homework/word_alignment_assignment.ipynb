(Currently the PriorModel is uniform.)\n","* How could you use a Hidden Markov Model to model word alignment indices? (There's an implementation of simple HMM below to help you start.)\n","* How could you initialize more complex models from simpler ones?\n","* How could you model words that are not aligned to anything?\n","\n","Grades will be assigned as follows*:\n","\n"," AER below on blinds   |  Grade \n","----------|-------------\n"," 0.5 - 0.6 |   1 \n"," 0.4 - 0.5 |   2 \n"," 0.35 - 0.4 |  3    \n","
